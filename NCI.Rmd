# Introduction

The method described and implemented in this file is a reading model based on the Construction-Integration (CI) framework [@Kintsch1998]. The present method expands the CI framework with the implementation of network analysis of texts in the construction of semantic representations, substituting the use of manually constructed propositions.

```{r include=FALSE}
# Load the necessary packages
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)

text = read_file('NCI_text1.txt')
```
